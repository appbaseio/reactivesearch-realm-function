## ReactiveSearch Realm Project

The ReactiveSearch Realm project deploys the ReactiveSearch API as a transpiled JS code into a Realm function. The goal of this project is to enable Atlas Search users to be able to build search UIs using [Searchbox](https://opensource.appbase.io/searchbox) and [ReactiveSearch](https://opensource.appbase.io/reactivesearch) UI libraries.

### Getting Started

Start with deploying this project as a [Realm function](deploy.md) in your MongoDB environment.

### Search Use Cases with examples

Run different search use-cases with the deployed Realm function's API over [here](REST.md).

### Test with UI

Test the deployed Realm function with a React UI over [here](test-with-ui.md).
